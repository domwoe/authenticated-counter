Simple example project shows how to build a Web3 application on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).

It is based on the [vite-react-motoko starter](https://github.com/rvanasa/vite-react-motoko) by @rvanasa. For more awesome resources, check out [Awesome Internet Computer](https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-internet-computer).
The authentication code is primarily taken from the [example app in the Internet Identity repo](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/tree/main/demos/using-dev-build).

## How to get started

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 16.x` and [`dfx`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove) `>= 0.12.x` are installed on your system.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/domwoe/authenticated-counter # Clone this project
cd authenticated-counter # Enter the project directory
dfx start --clean --background # Run dfx in the background
npm run setup # Install packages, deploy canisters, and generate type bindings

npm start # Start the development server
```

When ready, run `dfx deploy` to build and deploy your application.

## Tips and Tricks

- Customize your project's code style by editing the `.prettierrc` file and then running `npm run format`.
- Reduce the latency of update calls by passing the `--emulator` flag to `dfx start`.
- Install a Motoko package by running `npx ic-mops add <package-name>`. Here is a [list of available packages](https://mops.one/).
- Split your frontend and backend console output by running `npm run frontend` and `npm run backend` in separate terminals.
